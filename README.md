In addition to the backend views that was requested of me, I have written some basic UI just for fun.

The assignment took around 5 hours(containing the hour that took me to understand that the django server and pycharm weren't aligned).
I admit that the long addition took some time.
I have learned how validate form fields in django (you can view it in forms.py).

I have chosen to transfer the numbers in the body of the request because I thought there should be a form in which the user could
fill the fields and sumbit the form. Therefore I have selected the HTTP post method for it. I even implemented that.
